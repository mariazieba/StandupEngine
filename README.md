# StandupEngine
Add an unnecessary, yet fun, twist to your daily standups with some [dad jokes](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/) and nes css retro design. Written in Blazor WASM. Styled with [nes.css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/). Inspired by [StandupLand](https://github.com/Coreusa/standupland).

## How to use Standup Engine?
- Enter all of your teammates names on the left - you don't need to do it every time!
- Select colleagues that are present by clicking on their names one by one - or all of them at once. You will get a nice greeting if you're lucky.

- Click the big green button at the bottom, sit back, enjoy some of the best dad jokes and let the engine decide who will speak... and how.
